This film series is about a young hobbit, Frodo, who has found the One Ring that belongs to the Dark Lord Sauron, begins his journey with eight companions to Mount Doom, the only place where it can be destroyed.\n\nIt is said that the reason this trilogy was so succesful is that the writter included so much detail and crafted such a wonderful and interesting story that it was still well loved when released in cinemas 50 years later. And there's no reason to think anything will change in another 50 years. The story features a number of diversions and twists, If you haven't seen it before and you love adventure films i'm sure our recommendation model which we will build later on will lead you to this trilogy🙂\n\nWe also see some of the best movies based DC comic books(my personal favourite kind of literature) two of which are from the Dark Knight trilogy which are The Dark Knight and Batman begins, we also see Spiderman which was written by the Legendary Marvel comic book superheros creator Stan Lee.\n\nSomething worth noting here again is the trend we saw ealier that as most recent movies don't really have that higher number of ratings as we see that 25 most rated movies of the 21st centure were all released before 2010.\n\n\n\nNow that we have have seen which movies were most rated we can now investigate the best and worst rated movies on average, one thing we have to be aware of here is the is that when calculating the average best and worst rated movies, if a movie is rated by one user and that user gave it 5 star then it will top the chart which would be misleading as such to avoid this we will develop a threshold for number of ratings that a movie should have before we can include its average rating.\n\n\From the two bar plots above we see that alot of movies have recieve over 10 000 ratings and as such we will make this our threshold")
